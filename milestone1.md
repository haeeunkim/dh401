# Research Question
- What do you want to study? : difference in rhythmic flow btw American rap and french rap
- What is the larger context of your project? :
- Why is it interesting (for you)? : Hiphop/rap is not studied enough (yet), whereas it is an intereseting field of study and music. Furthermore, we can sense the difference while listening hiphop/rap from different languages/countries. -> that motivated us.
- What are possible outcomes? -> we can numerically observe the difference btw american/french rap
# Concepts and Data
- What is the concrete focus of your project?
- Which musically relevant concepts do you use or study?
- How can they be operationalized?
- Which datasets can help you answer your research question?
- Do they already exist or do you need to create / transform them?

- What is the concrete focus of your project? 
We will focus our project on the rhythmic part of the rap flow. We w


- Which musically relevant concepts do you use or study?
We will use the rhythmic features linked to the flow of the rapper essentially based on the syllables, we will also use features linked to the pitch accents and contours in flow but we do not know yet if we will use them a lot or not since we focus our project mainly on the rhythmic part of the rapper.


- How can they be operationalized?
We can operationalized these features by encoding the flow of the rapper into a symbolic rhythmic representation and then extract the features linked to this representation like the speed, rhyme density, metric position of stressed syllables, metric position of rhymes, phrase length and the metric position of phrases. (We took these features because we want to compare our study to the MCFlow one so we need to have to same features. But we will discuss later on the semester on how these features represent “correctly” the data and if we need to change them to improve our results.
- Which datasets can help you answer your research question?
For the English part, we found a database containing 124 popular rap songs where they extracted each features into “humdrum-syntax” text file. This database is called MCFlow and comes from the university of Ohio (December 2015). Since we want to compare the results of this study to the French rap part, we need a database of French rap songs with the same features. We did not find any data base so we will build our own by selecting a representative part of French rap songs. To do so, we will first analyze the songs from the MCFlow data base so we can select the same time period and “sub style” of rap songs than the MCFLow data base.
As said previously, we will discuss the necessity to transform, change the features that we will need for our study. If we find that it will improve our results, we will modify our data base and the MCFlow one too so we will adapt them to the new required features.
- Do they already exist or do you need to create / transform them?

# Methods
- Which methods are you planning to use? -> read the reference articles to answer this
- How are they related to the research question?
# Literature
- What is the state-of-the-art in relation to your question? Name at least 3 relevant publications. -> https://emusicology.org/article/view/6986, 
- Which issues are not yet addressed that your project supplements?
# Two more things
- For which part of your project do you need input and/or support from our side? -> support in how to analyze the encoded result. determining the relevant features, How to choose the french songs (since we need to encode some songs by our own)
- You could already have a look into datasets suitable for you project
