    "## 1. Narrowing down the research question\n",
    "As discussed in the feedback session, your research question needs to be pinned down to one or several concrete and attainable goals. In the first section of the notebook please address the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Name your concrete questions and explain them briefly.\n",
    ": Rap -  important vocal artistry. Well-known rap genres : include pop, gangster, old school.. \n",
    "Even though all those rap subgenres share common grounds, (general characteristics on rap music), intergenre difference is also significant.\n",
    "it reflect the assumed audience of the songs, the place it will be played (club? dance floor? or underground studio? or something else?) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In some studies on rap, general idea of rhythmic onset/ history based approach/ has been analyzed. But still, the genre-specific characteristics are hightly deprecated, especially in musicology studies\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, different rap genres. (phrasing? phrase length. flow length (break with rest), distribution of syllabic onsets lengths)\n",
    "we choose gangter and old school rap in anglophone data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyse how these questions relate to your original idea, that is, in what way they narrow it down.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the dataset of MCFlow, which is publically available on website www.rapscience.net. \n",
    "\n",
    "M.C.Flow transcriptions are encoded as Humdrum-Syntax text files. Eight humdrum spines are used to encode information in each transcription. Each spine has it's own, original humdrum interpretation. The eight interpretations are:\n",
    "- recipx : the rhythmic duration of syllables.\n",
    "- stress : whether each syllable is stressed (1) or unstressed (0).\n",
    "- tone : formation about pitch accents and other notable pitch contours in flow, including boundary tones.\n",
    "- break : the boundaries between prosodic units.\n",
    "- rhyme\n",
    "- ipa : the pronunciation of each syllable using the International Phonetic Alphabet.\n",
    "- lyrics : The lyrics of the rap in normal English spelling, as well as some basic information about syntactic boundaries in the flow.\n",
    "- hype : additional hype vocals that happen in a rap song.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the fact that not all of the interpretations are present in the MCFlow dataset, and also the complexity of encoding stress, tone, rhype, and ipa on our own, we are using only 'recipx','break', and 'lyrics'. Using the selected interpretations, we can define the 'rhythmic flow' in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- phrase-based: Flow breaks with a comma(,), period(.), or phrasal break in lyrics. This corresponds to the line break or semantic subphrase of lyrics.\n",
    "- rest-based: Flow breaks with a rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "On the other hand, we will encode the French part into MusicXML files which is a standart XML file but modified to contain the musical information we need (see section 2 for further explanations). We selected the French songs based on the popularity of the songs in each genre/style. For now we have a list of 20 songs per genre but we will at first restrict to 10 songs per genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss how the data enables you to answer your questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of all the features, we will be enable to determine the syllable rate, the rhyme density, the average rhyme chain, syncopation (if we implement the syllables stress), the proportion of the metric position of syllables and rhymed syllables and so on for each song, artist, genre or languages. These results will lead us to some differences between genre and languages.\n",

    "\n",
    "Formulate educated guesses on your outcomes based on this data.\n",
    ": songs from similar genres will show 'closer' distance and higher similarities towards songs from the same genre, compared to ones from another genre. Observe different distribution of the parameter we choose. \n",

    "As mentioned above, the anglophone is already online in MCFlow website(http://www.rapscience.net/Data/downloads.html). 124 songs are collected in a single zip file. Once unzipped these files can be easily read in any text editing program, or even loaded into spreadsheet software. Since our goal is not restoring the origial songs, bur rather statistically analyzing them, we are not using a Humdrum Toolkit to interpret the encoded songs. Instead, we are using pandas library for analysis. \n",

    "Whereas there are 124 songs in the dataset, the final dataset size may differ according to the genre selection and classification results. For the moment, we have two genres(gangsta and old-school), 26 songs each, which makes our anglophone dataset contain 52 songs.\n",

    "For the French part: After the songs’s selection, we will encode them like this: First you download the mp3 version of the song (from youtube for example), then you add this song to a new track on a musical producing software (here it will be Logic pro). Then, you determine its tempo and you synchronize the beat on the song. After this, we add a new track and we tap the same note (A for example) on a pad (or keyboard) when we ear a syllable. We do this for the entire song and then we add the lyrics to each syllables on another note (G for example) and we do the same for the rhyme position and the breaks (and maybe the stress position of the syllables). Finally, we can export it as a MusicXML file and we will get the data with the help of a XML parser.\n",

    "\n",
    "We did an encoding test of a song without encoding the (un)stressed syllables and it took us an entire day. But we think that we can do one song in one afternoon (it depends on the genre of the song) so we can maybe have 15 to 20 songs in total until April 20th but it is still not the right timing estimation…\n",
